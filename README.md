## CSS

Style using [Emotion's CSS object styles](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop#object-styles). To see examples look to the ResourceAccess or Metadata modules and related components.

We no longer write new Sass for this project.

## Local Development

Local development will only work if you have access to the UMich network. This is a requirment for communicating with the backend service (Spectrum).

## Contact

Email Jon Earley at earleyj@umich.edu if you have any questions.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). This will explain why you are seeing a lack of configuration (babel, webpack...) since Create React App is for "creating React apps with no build configuration".
